This is a report about gun murders in the US.  Date is available here:   xxxxxxxx
We are going to use the Tidyverse library:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

and load the dataset, murders, that has been wrangled into submission:

```{r load}
load("rda/murders.rda")
```

a summary of the data: 

```{r}
summary(murders)
```


```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
murders %>% mutate(abb = reorder(abb, rate)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(abb, rate)) + 
  geom_bar(width = 0.5, stat = "identity", color = "black") +
  coord_flip()
```
